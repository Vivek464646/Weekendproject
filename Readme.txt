SIMPLE BANKING SYSTEM


In this project,a simple banking system is depicted.Since there are no databases includedin the project,the account was created manually by taking the unputs from the user.
Now the account balance is initially take as zero.The user is given a menu to chose between Loans section and other banking services.If the user select loans,he/she would be again given an 
option to select the type of loan..There are agricultural,vehicle,home and industry loans which all the loans have seperate loan rates and different loan repayment years.So the
user enters an amount and he will get the amount he need to pay after a certain amount of time.
And for the other banking options there are balance enquiry,deposit,withdraw,previous transaction.
For balance enquiry the function for balance enquiry is called and the balance variable is printed.
For deposit and withdraw ,we call the respective functions and the amount is added and subtracted from the balance variable.
For previous transaction ,we call the function and print the previous transaction variable.
